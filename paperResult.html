My grandpa lets me use a jetpack whenever\nwe visit him.”</div>\n\n<div>I knew that Tex had a great imagination (想象), but I\nhad never <u>  4  </u> him tell a lie before.

Her dad is astronaut Scott Kelly.</div>\n\n<div>All\nIn a Year</div>\n\n<div>May 18, 2015</div>\n\n<div>It has been almost eight weeks since my dad\nleft the Earth. I am able to have video calls with my dad about once a month.\nWe had our second video call yesterday. Dad is doing well and staying very\nbusy. He has a lot of work to do! He taught me how to reply to his emails. I’m\nnot very good at that. He has given me a tour of parts of the International\nSpace Station and I was able to meet a few of the other astronauts. I do miss\nhim and the video calls make it a lot easier.</div>\n\n<div>Happy\nFather’s Day</div>\n\n<div>June 21, 2015</div>\n\n<div>I am on summer break from school right now,\nbut before school ended, my dad was able to have a video call with my class.\nAll of the kids really enjoyed seeing him and asking him questions about space.\nI don’t care how many times I see it; I still have to laugh when I see him\nfloating around. Two nights ago, my mum and I went to a beach party with my\nclassmate Joe and his family. Just around 9:10 p.m., we were all able to look\ninto the night sky and see the International Space Station fly over. For those\nfour minutes we were all watching; I couldn’t help but miss my dad. Today is Father’s\nDay. My sister and I were able to have a video talk with our dad at the same\ntime. She was in Houston, I was in Virginia Beach and my dad was flying over\nus! He took a picture of me with Virginia Beach in the background.</div>\n\n",

They walked many miles to get the water. It was hot, and they\nwere tired. They could only carry a few containers a day. A young British woman\nlearned about how difficult this was for them. She wanted to help. </div>\n\n<div>Who is the young woman? Her name is Emily Cummins. How did she help?\nShe invented a water carrier for the people in Kenya.</div>\n\n<div>Emily Cummins is an engineer. She designs useful products for places\nwithout many natural resources. These places often don’t have a lot of water.\nThey also don’t have a lot of oil, coal or gas. Cummins’ products don’t use\noil, coal or gas. They use other kinds of energy, such as the sun. So people\ncan continue to use them in the future without hurting our planet. </div>\n\n<div>How did Cummins get started? As a young child in England, she loved\nto work with her grandfather in his workshop. He taught her how to use his\ntools. He showed her how to make toys and boxes from small pieces of metal. </div>\n\n<div>Cummins designed her first product when she was in high school and\njust 15 years old. While she was still a high school student, Cummins designed\na new kind of fridge. Why? Fridges normally use a lot of electricity. They are\ntoo expensive for many people in developing countries. Cummins' fridge is not\nexpensive. It's made of cheap, local materials. </div>\n\n<div>After leaving school, Cummins spent five months in Africa. She\nwanted to learn more about life there, so she volunteered at a school in\nNamibia. There, she could test and improve her designs. Her fridge became a\ngreat success! It has helped thousands of people.</div>\n\n",

But for most of the race’s 119-year history, only\nmen were allowed to compete. </div>\n\n<div>A woman named Gibb helped change that in 1966. That year she took\npart in the Boston Marathon and finished ahead of (在……前面) most\nof the men. Gibb first saw and got to know the Boston Marathon in 1964. And she\nwanted to run the race herself. For nearly two years, Gibb trained hard to prepare\nfor the race. But when she sent in an application for the 1966 race, she was\nrefused. </div>\n\n<div>At the time, the longest official races for women were only 1.5\nmiles. Many people didn’t think women were able to run longer than that. But\nthe 23-year-old Gibb refused to give up her dream. She came up with a plan to\nrun the race anyway. On April 19, she showed up at the marathon. She wore her\nbrother’s shorts and a sweatshirt to disguise that she was a woman.</div>\n\n<div>Gibb hid near the starting line. When the race began, she jumped\ninto the crowd. Shortly into the race, Gibb took off her sweatshirt. To her\nsurprise, the crowd cheered when they realized she was a woman. Gibb finished\nthe race in 3 hours and 21 minutes — faster than two thirds of the men. </div>\n\n<div>In the years that followed, she and other women ran in the Boston\nMarathon, even though the rules still stopped women from running in the race.\nFinally, in 1972, the marathon was officially opened to women. </div>\n\n",

It is in\nCentral America and is 50 miles long. It lets ships pass between the Atlantic\nand Pacific oceans. The French started the project in the 1880s. However, the\nwork was too difficult, and they stopped. The United States continued the\nproject in 1904 and finished it in 1914. About 56,300 people worked on the\ncanal. </div>\n\n<div>The area around the canal was very dangerous. It was very hot and\nwet, with about 267cm of rain in a year. The heavy rain often made the rivers\nflood. Thousands of workers died from illnesses and accidents. </div>\n\n<div>One of the greatest engineering achievements of the 20th century was\nthe Alaska Pipeline (阿拉斯加输油管). In 1968, an oil company found the largest oil field in North\nAmerica. But, how could they get oil from Alaska to the rest of the United\nStates? They worked with some other oil companies to build a pipeline. </div>\n\n<div>The Alaska Pipeline is one of the longest pipelines in the world. It\ncarries oil for 800 miles through the cold, hard land of Alaska. It crosses\nthree mountains and more than 800 rivers. More than 70,000 workers built it.\nThey worked for more than three years in very cold temperatures.
